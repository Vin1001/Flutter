Currently, in Indian judicial system the prosecution presents a physical document denoting the map of crime/accident scene/property disputes. Using the [Mappls API](https://about.mappls.com/api/) a scene map creator has been developed to fully digitize the process. The software renders the map based on fed co-ordinates and the customizable markers represent the entities/evidences present at the scene.
